= User Code Deployment
:description: Hazelcast allows you to deploy your own custom and domain classes to cluster members. From Hazelcast Platform Operator, you can deploy your application code from external buckets and ConfigMap objects in Kubernetes.

{description}

This topic explains how to configure code deployments. It also brings together examples of when you might use code deployments as part of the configuration of other features, such as the xref:hazelcast:data-structures:working-with-external-data.adoc[implementation of an external data store] or an xref:hazelcast:computing:executor-service.adoc[executor service] for the asynchronous execution of tasks.

== Configuring User Code Deployment

Below are the configuration options for the User Code Deployment feature.

[cols="20%m,80%a"]
|===
|Field|Description

|`clientEnabled`
|When set to true, this option enables custom code deployment from Hazelcast clients.

|`bucketConfig`
|JAR files from an external bucket are placed under the Java classpath when the following parameter values are supplied:

  - `secret`: Name of the Secret object which holds the credentials for your cloud provider.
  - `bucketURI`: Full path for the external bucket. For example: `gs://your-bucket/path/to/jars`.

|`configMaps`
|Files specified in the ConfigMaps are placed under the Java classpath.

WARNING: The data stored in a ConfigMap cannot exceed 1 MiB. For more info, see link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/#motivation[Kubernetes Documentation for Config Map].

|`triggerSequence`
|Triggers a rolling restart to begin another download of the custom code.

|===

=== Example Configuration

The example configuration below:

* downloads the JAR files from the specified external bucket and places them under the classpath of each of the Hazelcast members
* puts all the files specified in the ConfigMap objects under the classpath of each of the Hazelcast members. 

WARNING: Currently, mounted persistent volumes are not supported; only cloud provider external buckets are supported.

== Configuring an External Data Store with Hazelcast Platform Operator

The `MapLoader` and `MapStore` interfaces in Hazelcast allow you to load map entries from and save map entries to an external data store. See xref:hazelcast:data-structures:working-with-external-data.adoc[Working with an External Data Store] for implementation details.

To use an external data store, you need to create `MapLoader` and/or `MapStore` classes and add configuration. In Hazelcast Platform Operator:

. Deploy the `MapLoader` and/or `MapStore` classes to the classpath of each Hazelcast member.
. Configure a `Map` resource for the MapLoader or MapStore.

Use the following configuration options in the `Map` resource for a MapStore. The example shows how you might implement these options. For more detailed information,  see the xref:api-ref.adoc#mapstoreconfig[API Reference].

|===
|Field|Description

|`initialMode`
|Sets the initial entry loading mode. LAZY is the default load mode, where load is asynchronous. EAGER means map operations are blocked until all partitions are loaded.

|`className`
|Name of your class that implements the `MapLoader` and/or `MapStore` interface.

|`writeDelaySeconds`
|Number of seconds to delay the storing of map entries.

|`writeBatchSize`
|Used to create batches when writing to the map store. In default mode, with a value of less than two, Hazelcast tries to write all map entries in one go.

|`writeCoealescing`
|For use with write-behind mode in a MapStore. When this option is set to true, Hazelcast coalesces updates on a specific key, and so applies only the last update. Set this option to false to store all updates performed on a key to the data store.

|`propertiesSecretName`
|You can use properties to give information to the MapStore implementation. In this case, properties are taken from the secret with the given name.

== Configuring Executor Services with the Hazelcast Platform Operator

Hazelcast offers an executor service (`IExecutorService`), which is an implementation of `java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService`. With `IExecutorService`, you can execute tasks asynchronously and perform other useful tasks.

To use the executor service, you need to create `Callable` and/or `Runnable` classes and add configuration. In Hazelcast Platform Operator:

. Deploy your `Callable` or `Runnable` classes to the classpath of each Hazelcast member.
. Configure a `Hazelcast` resource for the `Callable` or `Runnable` interface.

There are three variants of the executor service:

- Executor Service
- Durable Executor Service
- Scheduled Executor Service.

Configuration options for a `Hazelcast` resource to work with all three variants are shown in this section, along with examples of how you might implement these options. For more detailed implementation information, see xref:hazelcast:computing:executor-service.adoc[Java Executor Service].

== Configuring an Entry Processor with Hazelcast Platform Operator

An entry processor executes your code on a map entry in an atomic way. To implement the `EntryProcessor` interface, you can deploy an `EntryProcessor` class from the Hazelcast Platform Operator to the classpath of a Hazelcast member. See xref:hazelcast:computing:entry-processor.adoc[Entry Processor] for more detailed information.
