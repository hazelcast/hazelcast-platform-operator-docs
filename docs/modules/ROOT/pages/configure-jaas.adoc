:description: This topic explains how to configure JAAS-based authentication.

{description}

Hazelcast Operator supports JAAS-based authentication. JAAS (Java Authentication and Authorization Service) is a flexible authentication framework used in Hazelcast for security purposes. It allows you to implement custom authentication and authorization mechanisms for both cluster members and clients.

You can use Hazelcast Operator to configure JAAS-based authentication. To do this, configure `realms.jaas` in the Security section of the Hazelcast CR. For more information, see xref:api-ref.adoc#security[API types].

For more information about using JAAS in Hazelcast, see: link:https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/latest/security/jaas-authentication[JAAS authentication].
