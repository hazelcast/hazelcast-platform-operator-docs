= Configure JAAS-based authentication
:description: Operator supports JAAS-based authentication. JAAS (Java Authentication and Authorization Service) is a flexible authentication framework used in Hazelcast for security purposes. It allows you to implement custom authentication and authorization mechanisms for both cluster members and clients.

{description}

You can use Operator to configure JAAS-based authentication. To do this, configure `realms.jaas` in the Security section of the Hazelcast CR. For more information, see xref:api-ref.adoc#security[API types].
