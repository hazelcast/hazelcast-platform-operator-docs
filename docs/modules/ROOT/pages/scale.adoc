= Scale a Hazelcast deployment
:page-aliases: scaling-upgrading.adoc

To scale an existing Hazelcast deployment, there are two options:

- Modify the YAML definition you used to deploy Hazelcast cluster by updating `clusterSize` field and re-apply it again:
+
For example, if the existing configuration has a cluster size of three:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: hazelcast.com/v1alpha1
kind: Hazelcast
metadata:
  name: hazelcast-sample
spec:
  clusterSize: 3
----
+
You can scale your deployment to five replicas by updating the `clusterSize` field and applying:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: hazelcast.com/v1alpha1
kind: Hazelcast
metadata:
  name: hazelcast-sample
spec:
  clusterSize: 5
----

// RJS: How do you apply YAML config changes?

- Alternatively, you can use the `scale` command:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl scale hazelcast <name> --replicas <replica-count>
----
+
For example:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl scale hazelcast hazelcast-sample --replicas 5
----

// RJS: How do you verify it's worked? What's the behavior / service interruption when you scale up/down?
