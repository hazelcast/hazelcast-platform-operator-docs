= Deploy Flow

:description: In this tutorial, you'll deploy a Flow application using Hazelcast Platform Operator for Kubernetes.

{description}

See xref:flow:ROOT:index.adoc[Flow] for more detailed information.

== Prerequisites

- Flow requires the Management Center application to run and be configured properly. The Management Center application should be configured to use FLow.

[source,yaml]
----
...
image: docker.io/hazelcast/management-center-flow <1>
...
hazelcastClusters:
- address: flow <2>
  name: flow <3>
jvm:
  args:
  - "-Dhazelcast.mc.flow.addresses=http://233.252.0.158/" <4>
  - "-Dhazelcast.mc.internal.flowAddresses=http://flow:9021" <5>
...
----

<1> Management Center Flow image.
<2> The service name of the Flow application. The same as the Flow Custom Resource (CR) name.
<3> Hazelcast cluster name. Should always be `flow`.
<4> Flow Ingress public address.
<5> The internal address of Flow in the format of `http://<service-name>:9021`. The service name is the same as the Flow CR name.

- To connect to PostgreSQL database you need create a `Secret` with the DB credentials:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl create secret generic flow-db-secret \
  --from-literal=database=flow \
  --from-literal=username=flow \
  --from-literal=password="strong-password"
----

In the created secret `username` and `password` are required, whereas `database` field is optional and will default to `flow` if not provided.

== Run Flow

To run Flow on Kubernetes using Hazelcast Platform Operator you need to create a Flow CR.

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$/flow.yaml[]
----

Additional flow configuration can be achieved by providing additional parameters using the `OPTIONS` environment variable. See xref:flow:introduction:index.adoc[Configure Flow] for detailed information.

NOTE: Parameters managed by the Hazelcast Platform Operator are not allowed in `OPTIONS`. E.g., the Database configuration can only be done via `spec.database` in the Flow CR.

=== Configure OpenID support

You can enable OpenID support with Management Center deployment on Flow. To configure OpenID, provide the required parameters to the `OPTIONS` environment variable.
See xref:flow:deploy:security-recommendations.adoc[Security recommendations] to discover all available options.

[source,yaml]
----
...
- name: OPTIONS
  value: |
      --flow.security.openIdp.enabled=true
      --flow.security.openIdp.jwks-uri=http://233.252.0.158/mc/oauth2/jwks
      --flow.security.openIdp.issuerUrl=http://233.252.0.158/mc
      --flow.security.openIdp.clientId=flow-client
      --flow.security.openIdp.require-https=false
      --flow.security.open-idp.roles.format=path
      --flow.security.open-idp.roles.path=roles
      --flow.security.open-idp.refreshTokensDisabled=true
...
