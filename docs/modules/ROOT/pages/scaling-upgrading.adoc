= Scaling and Upgrading a Hazelcast Deployment

To scale an existing Hazelcast deployment, there are two options:

- Modify the yaml definition you used to deploy Hazelcast cluster by updating `clusterSize` field and re-apply it again:
+
Assuming the following is the existing configuration:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: hazelcast.com/v1alpha1
kind: Hazelcast
metadata:
  name: hazelcast-sample
spec:
  clusterSize: 3
----
+
and you want to scale your deployment to five replicas, you need to apply the following:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: hazelcast.com/v1alpha1
kind: Hazelcast
metadata:
  name: hazelcast-sample
spec:
  clusterSize: 5
----
+
- To scale an existing Hazelcast deployment, use the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl scale hazelcast <name> --replicas <replica-count>
----
+
Example:
+
[source,shell]
----
kubectl scale hazelcast hazelcast-sample --replicas 5
----

== Upgrading

Before upgrading, we recommend that you to read xref:hazelcast:maintain-cluster:rolling-upgrades.adoc#hazelcast-members-compatibility-guarantees[Rolling Upgrades] information.

To upgrade your existing deployment to a newer version, you need to update `spec.version` field and re-apply. For example:

Assuming the following is the existing configuration:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$/hazelcast-5.2.4.yaml[]
----

and you want to upgrade your Hazelcast version to {page-latest-supported-hazelcast}, you need to apply the following:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$/hazelcast.yaml[]
----

Each Operator version has been tested and validated to work correctly with a specific Hazelcast version. You can find the test matrix below. We highly recommend you to consider it to avoid issues during Operator installations.
