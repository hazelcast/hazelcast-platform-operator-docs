= Configure simple authentication and authorization
:description: This topic explains how to configure simple authentication and authorization for clients.

{description}

Hazelcast Operator supports simple authentication and authorization for client connections, bringing native security controls to Operator-managed clusters. You can define authentication realms using Kubernetes secrets, assign roles (admin, monitor, application), and configure fine-grained permissions with InstancePermission and ClusterPermission. 

The Operator retrieves admin credentials directly from `operatorClientSecretName`, eliminating manual configuration. This  ensures secure, role-based access control, simplifies client authentication setup, and aligns with Hazelcast's standard security model for a seamless Kubernetes integration.

You can use Hazelcast Operator to configure simple authentication and authorization for clients. To do this, configure `realms.simple` in the Security section of the Hazelcast CR. For more information, see xref:api-ref.adoc#security[API types].
