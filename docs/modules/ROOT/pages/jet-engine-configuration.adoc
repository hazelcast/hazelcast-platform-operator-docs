= Configuring the Jet Engine
:description: Data Pipelines allow you to process data stored in one location and send the result to another, such as from a data lake to an analytics database or into a payment processing system. You can also use the same source and sink so the pipeline only processes data. You can configure Hazelcastâ€™s Jet engine using the Hazelcast Platform Operator.

{description}

== Configuring the Jet Engine
The Jet engine is enabled by default and has the following configuration options. For more detailed information, see the xref:api-ref.adoc#jetengineconfiguration[API Reference].
