= Connecting to Hazelcast from Outside Kubernetes
:description: Hazelcast supports connections from both smart and unisocket clients that are outside your Kubernetes cluster. To allow these clients to connect to Hazelcast, you need to configure the `exposeExternally` field of the Hazelcast custom resource.

{description}

TIP: For a working example, see link:https://docs.hazelcast.com/tutorials/hazelcast-platform-operator-expose-externally/[this tutorial].

== Environmental Constraints

The `kubectl` command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster.

.Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
[%collapsible]
====
If you use GKE, consider the following:

- Make sure the Kubernetes cluster is public.
- If you plan on using NodePorts, (`discoveryServiceType: NodePort` or `memberAccess: NodePortExternalIP`), set up a firewall rule for each Hazelcast member to allow TCP traffic on node ports.
====

.Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
[%collapsible]
====
If you use EKS, consider the following:

- Having the VPC of the EKS cluster configured only with private subnets is not recommended.
- If you plan on using NodePorts, (`discoveryServiceType: NodePort` or `memberAccess: NodePortExternalIP`), the VPC of the EKS cluster should be configured only with public subnets. Additionally, inbound rules for the node ports should be added to the nodes' security groups.
====

.Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
[%collapsible]
====
If you use AKS, consider the following:

- Make sure the Kubernetes cluster is public.

- If you plan on using NodePorts, (`discoveryServiceType: NodePort` or `memberAccess: NodePortExternalIP`), the node pools should be created by using the `--enable-node-public-ip` flag. Additionally, the required inbound rules should be added for network security groups (NSGs) to allow access to node IPs and ports.

== Configuring `exposeExternally`

To allow connections from clients, you need to configure the `exposeExternally` field, of the Hazelcast custom resource. This field has the following properties:

[cols="20%m,80%a"]
|===
|Property|Description

|type
|The way in which Hazelcast members are exposed to clients:

- `Unisocket`: Members are exposed through one Kubernetes service that automatically load balances the traffic to Hazelcast members. Use this property if your clients use the unisocket operation mode.
- `Smart`: Each member is exposed through a separate Kubernetes service that allows clients to send requests directly to the members that own a particular partition. Use this property if your clients use the smart operation mode.

|discoveryServiceType
|Type of Kubernetes service used for discovering members in a Hazelcast cluster:

- `LoadBalancer` (default): Hazelcast client configuration `<load-balancer-external-ip>:5701`.
+
WARNING: Your Kubernetes cluster should be able to assign public IPs to LoadBalancer services.
- `NodePort`: Hazelcast client configuration `<node-address>:<node-port>`.
|memberAccess
|The way in which clients access Hazelcast members:

- `LoadBalancer`: Hazelcast clients are outside the Kubernetes network and can access members, using the external IP that is assigned to the `LoadBalancer` service.
- `NodePortExternalIP` (default): Hazelcast clients are outside the Kubernetes network, so a client can access members only via the public IP address that's assigned to their Kubernetes nodes.
- `NodePortNodeName`: Hazelcast clients are inside the same network as the Kubernetes nodes, so clients can access a member by the hostname of its Kubernetes node.

|===

WARNING: If NodePorts are used (`discoveryServiceType: NodePort` or `memberAccess: NodePortExternalIP`), the Kubernetes nodes must allow external TCP traffic on node IPs and ports.

== Exposing Hazelcast to Smart Clients

Smart clients access partitioned data in a cluster by communicating with the partition owner. This operation mode increases the overall throughput and efficiency of client-cluster communication.

NOTE: For non-partitioned data, smart clients can communicate with any cluster member.

To support smart clients, you should configure the `type` property as `smart`.

In this configuration, the standard Kubernetes mechanism routes client traffic to the correct member. Or, if the client is not accessing partitioned data, the traffic is automatically load balanced.

== Exposing Hazelcast to Unisocket Clients

Unisocket clients communicate with a single member in the cluster. To enable these clients to connect to the Hazelcast cluster, you should configure the `type` property as `unisocket`.

In this configuration, the standard Kubernetes mechanism automatically load balances client traffic across the Hazelcast cluster.

== Example Configuration

In this example, the Hazelcast cluster is configured to load balance connections from smart clients.

.Example configuration
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$/hazelcast_expose_externally.yaml[]
----

This configuration creates a load balancer for the discovery service and one service for each member.

[source,shell]
----
kubectl get service
----

```
NAME                 TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)          AGE
hazelcast-sample     LoadBalancer   10.219.246.19    35.230.92.217   5701:30560/TCP   2m11s <1>
hazelcast-sample-0   NodePort       10.219.254.192   <none>          5701:31890/TCP   2m11s <2>
hazelcast-sample-1   NodePort       10.219.247.43    <none>          5701:32310/TCP   2m11s <2>
hazelcast-sample-2   NodePort       10.219.243.16    <none>          5701:32585/TCP   2m11s <2>
```

<1> Discovery service
<2> Member access service

The command below allows you to list the external addresses of the cluster.

[source,shell]
----
kubectl get hazelcastendpoint --selector="app.kubernetes.io/instance=hazelcast-sample"
----

```
NAME               TYPE        ADDRESS
hazelcast-sample   Discovery   35.230.92.217:5701
```

Smart clients can use the external IP of the load balancer to connect to the cluster.
