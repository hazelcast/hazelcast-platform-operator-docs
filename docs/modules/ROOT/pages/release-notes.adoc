= 5.7 Release Notes

This release introduced the xref:get-started.adoc#step-1-deploy-hazelcast-platform-operator[cluster-scoped operator], xref:tls.adoc[custom TLS] and xref:native-memory.adoc[native memory] configuration options, and Near Cache support for the Map CR. The release also added configuration options for the xref:jvm-parameters.adoc[JVM Garbage Collector (GC)], and xref:advanced-networking.adoc[advanced networking], along with Ingress & OCP Route support for external connectivity to Management Center.

== Changes
- Removed support for `hostPath` option for configuring persistent storage in Hazelcast (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/607[#607])
- Added the default port `5701` to endpoints used in WAN Replication (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/662[#662])
- WAN Replication is now automatically triggered for newly created Map CRs in the Hazelcast resource (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/656[#656])
- Added external Ingress and Route addresses to Management Center (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/643[#643])
- Maps without a `publisherID` are now deleted from the WAN status to resolve an issue where the finalizer did not exit successfully (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/615[#615])
- Updated the cluster service version (CSV) file for multi-namespace and cluster-wide operator support (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/599[#599])
- Added the  option to create a namespace-scoped cluster role for the Hazelcast Platform Operator (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/594[#594])
- Added support for the cluster-scoped operator to Helm chart (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/589[#589])
- Added a new installation option for using the Hazelcast Platform Operator with namespace-scoped roles in Helm chart (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/588[#588])
- The Webhook installation is now configurable in the Helm chart values field `webhook.enabled` (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/586[#586])
- Added MTLS secret generation by namespace (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/585[#585])
- Removed `Security Context Constraints` from permissions for the Hazelcast Platform Operator and Management Center. The Hazelcast Platform Operator no longer supports `hostPath` persistence in OpenShift environments (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/581[#581])
- Added a connectivity check to the WAN replication CR (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/541[#541])
- Changed `podManagementPolicy` to `Parallel` to improve cluster setup time (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/539[#539])
- Improved support for the cluster-scoped operator in the phone home package and Kubebuilder roles  (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/521[#521])
