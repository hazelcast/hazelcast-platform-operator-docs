= 5.7 Release Notes

This release introduced the xref:get-started.adoc#step-1-deploy-hazelcast-platform-operator[cluster-scoped operator], xref:tls.adoc[custom TLS] and xref:native-memory.adoc[native memory] configuration options, and Near Cache support for the Map CR. The release also added configuration options for the xref:jvm-parameters.adoc[JVM Garbage Collector (GC)], and xref:advanced-networking.adoc[advanced networking], along with Ingress & OCP Route support for external connectivity to Management Center.

- Add an external address for Ingress and Route in Management Center (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/643[#643])
- Improved map deletion from WAN status when publisher ID is empty and improved logs (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/615[#615])
- Update CSV file for multi-namespace and cluster-wide operator support (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/599[#599])
- Add option to create namespace-scoped cluster role for Hazelcast Platform Operator (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/594[#594])
