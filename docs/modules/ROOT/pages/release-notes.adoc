= 5.8 Release notes

This release added support for the xref:jet-job-configuration.adoc[JetJob CR], the xref:jet-job-snapshot.adoc[JetJobSnapshot CR], xref:custom-config.adoc[custom configs] using ConfigMap, and xref:serialization-configuration.adoc[serialization] config for the Hazelcast CR. Users can now use user code from URLs and submit the JetJob CR using an existing JAR file for running the Jet job. Additionally, we enhanced TLS support.

== New Features

- Added the JetJob CR, which provided a way to submit a Jet job using an existing Jar file (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/687[#687])
- The ability to configure `instance` and `edgeDefaults` Jet Configuration parameters in Hazelcast CR was added for users (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/678[#678])
- Persistence for Jobs has been enabled to provide Lossless Restart capability for users (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/730[#730])
- The ability to specify the HTTP URLs, where the Pipeline JARs are located, in the Hazelcast CR was added (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/726[#726])
- Added the JetJobSnapshot CR, which provided a way to export snapshots of JetJob CRs (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/791[#791])
- Added support for custom configs using ConfigMap via the `customConfigCmName` field in the Hazelcast CR (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/750[#750])
- Added support for serialization config for Hazelcast CR (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/743[#743])
- EventJournal configuration section is included in both Map and Cache CR (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/791[#791])
- Implemented the ability for users to deploy JARs and other files into members' CLASSPATH using URLs (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/699[#699])

== Changes
- The field `licenseKeySecret` in ManagementCenter CR was renamed to `licenseKeySecretName` and the field `secret` in HotBackup CR was renamed to `secretName` (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/740[#740])
- The fields `licenseKeySecret` and `secret` in Hazelcast CR were renamed to `licenseKeySecretName` and `secretName` respectively (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/735[#735])
- Hazelcast CR name validation was added to conform to DNS-1035 label (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/734[#734])
- Support for Hazelcast mTLS client-server communication has been added. Users now have the ability to enforce Hazelcast mutual authentication in TLS using the `tls.mutualAuthentication` property. (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/722[#722])
- Added new field validations for Management Center and Hazelcast CRs (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/709[#709])
- The separate secret for mTLS has been removed, enabling the utilization of a single secret to store all the required files for the operator and members (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/696[#696])
- Improved validation logic for multiple errors in the Webhooks and Reconciler (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/683[#683])

== Fixed Issues
- Jet Job submission and UCD from client/CLC is now possible (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/794[#794])
- Fix error in Map reconciler when nearCache is configured (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/786[#786])
- Added `spec.jet.bucketConfig.secretName` validation(https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/778[#778])
- Fixed a bug in Map config persistence caused by MapStore (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/776[#776])
- Validating secretName of bucket config in `Hazelcast.Jet` and `JetJob` CRs added (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/772[#772])
- Added validation for `NativeMemory.AllocatorType` when `Persistence` is enabled (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/767[#767])
- NativeMemory can now only be used with Hazelcast Enterprise, providing enhanced security and performance (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/759[#759])
- TLS can now be used exclusively with Hazelcast Enterprise version (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/756[#756])
- Enforced validation to require a non-empty secretName for TLS configuration (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/755[#755])
- Fixed a bug that caused Java exceptions when creating a Cache CR with improper `backupCount/asyncBackupCount` values (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/754[#754])
- Added `backupCount/asyncBackupCount` validation in Queue creation to prevent Java exceptions (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/753[#753])
- backupCount/asyncBackupCount validation in MultiMap creation was added (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/752[#752])
- Validation for the sum of backupCount and asyncBackupCount was added for Map CR (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/749[#749])
- TLS handshake error after redeploying cluster with the same name is fixed (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/738[#738])
- Converted the Jet config fields with no default value to pointer (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/731[#731])
- Removed TLS enterprise validation in Webhook (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/710[#710])
- Enhanced JetJob CR state validation to exclusively perform validation when there is a state change in the JetJob CR (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/793[#793])
- Secret validation of bucket config in JetJob CR was added (https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/787[#787])
