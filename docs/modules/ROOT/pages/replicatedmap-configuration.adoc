= Configuring Replicated Maps
:description: pass:q[A replicated map is a distributed key-value data structure where the data is replicated to all members in the cluster. It provides full replication of entries to all members for high-speed access. You can create and configure replicated maps using the `ReplicatedMap` custom resource.]

{description}

== Configuring a ReplicatedMap Resource

You can use any of the following configuration options in the `ReplicatedMap` resource. For more information, see the xref:api-ref.adoc#replicatedmapspec[API Reference].

|===
|Field|Description

|name
|Name of the ReplicatedMap configuration that you're creating. If empty, the custom resource (CR) name is used.

|hazelcastResourceName
|Defines the name of the Hazelcast resource.

|inMemoryFormat
|Internal storage format. Use either `OBJECT` or `BINARY`.

|asyncFillup
|Specifies whether the ReplicatedMap is available for reads before the initial replication is completed. Its default value is true. If set to false, i.e., synchronous initial fill up, no exception is thrown when the ReplicatedMap is not yet ready, but null values can be seen until the initial replication is completed.

== Example Configuration

The following `ReplicatedMap` custom resource creates a ReplicatedMap configuration for the `Hazelcast` resource that is defined in the `hazelcastResourceName` field.

.Example configuration
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$/replicatedmap.yaml[]
----

After creating the `ReplicatedMap` resource, use the following command to check its status:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl get replicatedmap replicatedmap-sample -o wide
----

```
NAME               STATUS    MESSAGE
replicatedmap-sample    Success
```
