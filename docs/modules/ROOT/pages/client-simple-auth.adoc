= Client Authentication and Authorization

Use the Hazelcast Platform Operator to configure xref:hazelcast:security:authentication-overview.adoc[Client Authentication] and xref:hazelcast:security:client-authorization.adoc[Client Authorization].

== Simple Authentication

You can easily use xref:hazelcast:security:simple-authentication.adoc[Hazelcast Simple Authentication] by making minimal changes in the original configuration.

For example:

[source,yaml]
----
security:
  enabled: true
  realms:
    - name: simpleRealm-clients
      authentication:
        simple:
          users:
          - secretName: user1-secret
            roles:
              - admin
          - secretName: user2-secret
            roles:
              - monitor
              - application
  client-authentication:
    realm: simpleRealm-clients
  client-permissions:
    all:
      principal: admin
      endpoints:
        - 127.0.0.1
    map:
      - name: playground
        actions:
          - all
      - name: accounts
        principal: monitor
        actions:
          - read
      - name: accounts
        principal: application
        endpoints:
          - 192.168.1.*
          - 192.168.2.*
        actions:
          - create
          - destroy
          - put
          - read
          - remove
          - lock
----

This can be converted as:

[source,yaml]
----
security:
    operatorClientSecretName: user1-secret
    realms:
      - name: simpleRealm-clients
        authentication:
          simple:
            users:
            - secretName: user1-secret
              roles:
                - admin
            - secretName: user2-secret
              roles:
                - monitor
                - application
    clientAuthentication:
      realm: simpleRealm-clients
    clientPermissions:
      all:
        principal: admin
        endpoints:
          - 127.0.0.1
      permissions:
        map:
          - name: playground
            actions:
              - all
          - name: accounts
            principal: monitor
            actions:
              - read
          - name: accounts
            principal: application
            endpoints:
              - 192.168.1.*
              - 192.168.2.*
            actions:
              - create
              - destroy
              - put
              - read
              - remove
              - lock

Required Changes:

* `security.enabled` should be removed.
* convert kebab cases to camel cases:
** `client-authentication` -> `clientAuthentication`
** `client-permissions` -> `clientPermissions`
* add `permissions` node to `clientPermissions` to wrap permissions other than `all`.

NOTE:  The `operatorClientSecretName` is a mandatory field required for the Operator to establish a connection with the Hazelcast cluster. The given user in the `operatorClientSecretName` field must have a role that has all the client permissions. Otherwise, the Operator will fail with a validation error.

=== Management Center Configuration

As the Management Center serves as a client of the Hazelcast cluster, it must be properly configured to connect to the cluster. The `security.clientSecretName` field in the `hazelcastClusters` section is utilized for this configuration.
