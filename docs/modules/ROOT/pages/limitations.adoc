== Limitations
:description: Operator supports the majority of Hazelcast configuration but does not recognize all changes made by other methods. In addition, some changes require a manual restart.

{description}

== Custom configuration

Modifying the following parameters in the Hazelcast Custom Resource will not trigger a rolling update of the cluster. To apply changes to this configuration, you must restart the Hazelcast pods manually.

* `spec.customConfigCmName` - Name of a ConfigMap containing custom Hazelcast configuration.
* `spec.customConfigSecretName` - Name of a Secret containing custom Hazelcast configuration.

== Manual actions

The following actions performed manually or through Management Center are **not recognized** by Operator and will not be reflected in the Custom Resource status or configuration.

* **Data structure operations:** Creating, modifying, or deleting data structures (Maps, Queues, Topics, MultiMaps, etc.) through Management Center or client APIs will not be tracked by Operator. Use the appropriate Custom Resources (e.g., `Map`, `Queue`, `Topic`, `MultiMap`) to manage data structures.

* **Changing cluster state:** Changing the cluster state (e.g., from ACTIVE to PASSIVE) through Management Center or the Hazelcast REST API will not be recognized by Operator. Cluster state changes should be managed through appropriate Custom Resources (e.g., `HotBackup` CR for backup operations).

* **Management Center diagnostic logs limitation:** Management Center cannot enable diagnostic logs in Operator, Kubernetes, and Docker deployments because the default diagnostic log location (`/opt/hazelcast`) is read-only in these environments. To work around this, you can direct diagnostic logs to STDOUT via Management Center, where they will mix with standard logs and can be picked up by log scraping services for persistence.

* **Starting Jet jobs:** Starting Jet jobs directly through the Management Center UI or REST API will not be recognized by Operator. Jet jobs should be managed using the `JetJob` Custom Resource.

* **Demoting/promoting Lite members:** Changing the Lite member status (demoting full members to Lite members or promoting Lite members to full members) through Management Center or Hazelcast REST API will not be recognized by Operator. Lite member configuration should be managed through the `Hazelcast` CR `spec.liteMember` field.
