= Configuring TLS
:description: Hazelcast TLS is a security feature that provides encryption and authentication of data transmitted between Hazelcast nodes, preventing unauthorized access and eavesdropping.

{description}

Hazelcast TLS uses standard SSL/TLS certificates, which can be obtained from trusted Certificate Authorities (CA) or self-signed. The certificates are used to establish trust between the communicating parties and ensure the authenticity of the communication channel.

See xref:hazelcast:security:tls-ssl.adoc[TLS/SSL Basics] for more detailed information about the configuration and behavior of TLS in Hazelcast.

== Prerequisites for TLS

Before you create and configure TLS, you need to create a Kubernetes secret. The Operator uses the secret to create a truststore and keystore, and it modifies the Hazelcast configuration accordingly.

Example:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl create secret generic example \
  --from-file=tls.crt=example.crt \
  --from-file=tls.key=example.key
----

`ca.crt` is optional. You can also provide it to create the truststore:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl create secret generic example \
  --from-file=tls.crt=example.crt \
  --from-file=tls.key=example.key \
  --from-file=ca.crt=ca.crt
----

NOTE: If you provide `ca.crt`, it creates a truststore using it, if you don't create it, the truststore and keystore will be the same.

NOTE: The Operator creates the keystore and truststore in link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_12[PKCS12] format.

WARNING: The provided `tls.key` must be unencrypted.

== Configuring Hazelcast TLS

Below are the configuration options for the TLS.

[cols="25%m,75%a"]
|===
|Field|Description

|`secretName`
| Specifies the name of Kubernetes TLS secret.

|`mutualAuthentication`
|  Mutual authentication configuration, available values are:

- `None` (default): The client side of the connection is not authenticated.  
- `Required`:  Server forces usage of a trusted client certificate
- `Optional`: Server asks for a client certificate, but it doesn't require it

|===

=== Example Configuration

The example configuration does the following:

- Enables member to member and member-client Hazelcast TLS connections
- Enforces mutual TLS authentication for cluster members

.Example Hazelcast configuration
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$/hazelcast-tls.yaml[]
----

.Example Management Center configuration
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$/management-center-tls.yaml[]
----

NOTE: To update TLS certificates, you need to delete and recreate the appropriate custom resource.
