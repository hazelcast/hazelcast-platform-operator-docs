= LDAP Security Provider
:description: This topic explains how to use your existing LDAP server for authentication/authorization in Management Center.

{description}

Hazelcast supports authentication and authorization against Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) servers.
You can use Hazelcast Operator to configure Management Center to use an LDAP server. 
For more information about using LDAP in the Management Center, see the link:https://docs.hazelcast.com/management-center/latest/deploy-manage/ldap[Management Center Documentation].

== Setting Up the LDAP security provider

You can configure either LDAP or LDAP over TLS (or LDAPS). To set up:

* LDAP â€” configure the `securityProvider.ldap` section in the Management Center CR

* LDAP over TLS (or LDAPS)
** Create a secret (the `secretName`) that contains the certificate and key. The operator will set up TrustStore and KeyStore automatically. If you do not create the secretName, a validation error will occur
** Configure the `securityProvider.ldap.tls` section in the Management Center CR

Use the following fields to configure the LDAP security provider:

[cols="30%m,70%a"]
|===
|Field|Description

|`url`
| URL of your LDAP server, including schema (ldap://) and port.

|`tls`
|Configuration for TLS:

- `secretName`: The name of the secret that contains the certificate and key for LDAP over TLS (or LDAPS)
- `startTLS`: Enable TLS encryption for LDAP connections to initiate a secure TLS connection over an initially unencrypted channel

|`credentialsSecretName`
| The name of the secret that contains `username` and `password` keys of a user that has admin privileges on the LDAP server. The `username` must be the distinguished name (DN) of the user. It is used to connect to the server when authenticating users.

|`userDN`
| DN to be used for searching users.

|`groupDN`
| DN to be used for searching groups.

|`adminGroups`
| Members of these groups and its nested groups have admin privileges on the Management Center.

|`userGroups`
| Members of these groups and its nested groups have read and write privileges on the Management Center.

|`readonlyUserGroups`
| Members of these groups and its nested groups have only read privilege on the Management Center.

|`metricsOnlyGroups`
| Members of these groups and its nested groups have the privilege to see only the metrics on the Management Center.

|`userSearchFilter`
| LDAP search filter expression to search for the users.

|`groupSearchFilter`
| LDAP search filter expression to search for the groups.

=== Example Management Center LDAP configuration

The following example shows how to create a `Secret` for the LDAP credentials:

[source,shell]
----
$ kubectl create secret generic ldap-credentials --from-literal=username="cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org" --from-literal=password="adminpassword"
$ kubectl get secret ldap-credentials -o=yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  password: YWRtaW5wYXNzd29yZA==
  username: Y249YWRtaW4sZGM9ZXhhbXBsZSxkYz1vcmc=
kind: Secret
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2023-10-11T10:51:37Z"
  name: ldap-credentials
  namespace: default
  resourceVersion: "59391"
  uid: 299e5d42-4c72-4877-9a99-c6ffa3c68d07
type: Opaque
----

The following example shows how to create the secret for LDAP/TLS:
[source,shell]
----
$ kubectl create secret tls mc-ldap-secret --cert=ca.crt --key=ca.keykgp
----

The following is an example configuration for the LDAP security provider:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$/management-center-ldap.yaml[]
----

The following is an example configuration for the LDAP over TLS (or LDAPS) security provider:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$/management-center-ldap-tls.yaml[]
----
