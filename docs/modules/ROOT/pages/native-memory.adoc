= Configuring the Native Memory Store
:description: The Native Memory Store is a pluggable memory manager. It allows you to set up different configurations, or stores, for your applicationâ€™s data structures on a single JVM. These memory stores form part of a common access layer which scales up to use a configured amount of memory on the JVM.

{description}

As well as providing more predictable application scaling, using a Native Memory Store boosts performance, reduces latency, and minimizes garbage collection pauses. 

== Configuring a Native Memory Store

Below are the configuration options for the Native Memory Store.

|Field|Description

|`allocatorType`
| Specifies the mechanism for allocating memory; either STANDARD or POOLED.

|`size`
|Size of the total native memory to allocate.

|`minBlockSize`
|Size of smallest block of memory to allocate.

|`pageSize`
|Size of the page in bytes to allocate as a block of memory.

|`metadataSpacePercentage`
|Percentage of the allocated native memory that is used for the metadata of other map components such as index (for predicates), offset, etc.

|===

=== Example Configuration

The example configuration does the following:

- Creates a cluster with `Native Memory` and the `POOLED` allocator enabled.
- Configures a map on the cluster to use native memory.
