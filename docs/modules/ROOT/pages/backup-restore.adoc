= Persistence, Backup and Restore
:description: Persistence allows individual members and whole clusters to recover data by persisting map entries, JCache data, and streaming job snapshots on disk. Members can use persisted data to recover from a planned shutdown (including rolling upgrades), a sudden cluster-wide crash, or a single member failure.

Persistence allows individual members and whole clusters to recover data by persisting map entries, JCache data, and streaming job snapshots on disk. Members can use persisted data to recover from a planned shutdown (including rolling upgrades), a sudden cluster-wide crash, or a single member failure.

This topic assumes that you know about Persistence in Hazelcast. To learn about Persistence, see the xref:hazelcast:storage:persistence.adoc[Platform documentation].

The Operator supports two options for enabling Persistence: PVC and `HostPath`. We recommend using PVC, so the examples on this page use this option. If you need to use `HostPath`, see <<hostpath,  HostPath Support for Persistence>>.

== Enabling Persistence
--
Before you can back up and restore Hazelcast data, you need to enable Persistence in the `Hazelcast` resource.

. Create the `Hazelcast` resource:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$/hazelcast-persistence.yaml[]
----
<1> Base directory of the backup data.
<2> <<recovery-policy, Cluster recovery policy>>.
<3> Size of the PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) where Hazelcast data is persisted.
+
NOTE: Make sure to calculate the total disk space that you will use. The total used disk space may be larger than the size of in-memory data, depending on how many <<hot-backup, hot backups>> you take.

. Apply the resource:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f ./hazelcast.yaml
----

. Check that Hazelcast members are ready:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=hazelcast
----
+
[source,bash]
----
NAME          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hazelcast-0   1/1     Running   0          2m
hazelcast-1   1/1     Running   0          1m
hazelcast-2   1/1     Running   0          1m

----

. Check that Hazelcast PVCs are created:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl get pvc -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=hazelcast
----
+
[source,bash]
----
NAME                                  STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
hot-restart-persistence-hazelcast-0   Bound    pvc-116b4084-a436-4462-b413-511b77df307b   20Gi       RWO            standard       2m
hot-restart-persistence-hazelcast-1   Bound    pvc-a7711b6b-dcbf-45cb-9577-8ce6b1892f2f   20Gi       RWO            standard       1m
hot-restart-persistence-hazelcast-2   Bound    pvc-64314d82-da7a-4e38-bd2d-e770a63dc4e8   20Gi       RWO            standard       1m

[[hot-backup]]
== Triggering a Single Hot Backup
After Persistence is enabled for the cluster, you can trigger hot backups, using a `HotBackup` resource.

. Create the `HotBackup` resource:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$/hot-backup.yaml[]
----

. Apply the resource:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f ./hot-backup.yaml
----

== Scheduling Hot Backups

You can schedule regular hot backups, using the `spec.schedule` field of a `HotBackup` resource.
--
. Create the `HotBackup` resource with a `schedule` field:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$/hot-backup-scheduled.yaml[]
----
+
This field takes a valid cron expression. For example:
+
[cols="1,1"]
|===
| ```30 10 * * *```
| On 10:30 AM every day

| ```0, 0, 1,15,25 * *```
| On 1st, 15th and 25th each month, midnight

| ```@monthly```
| Once a month, first of the month, midnight
|===

+
For the full list of the supported expression, please check the link:https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/robfig/cron/v3@v3.0.1#hdr-CRON_Expression_Format[library documentation].

. Apply the resource:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f ./hot-backup-scheduled.yaml
----
--

== Checking the Status of a Hot Backup

To check the status of a hot backup, run the following command:
[source,bash]
----
kubectl get hotbackup hot-backup
----

You should see the similar output that will indicate that the Hot Backup process finished successfully.
[source,bash]
----
NAME         STATUS
hot-backup   Success
----

== Restoring from Hot Backups
To restore a cluster from hot backups, you can reapply the `Hazelcast` resource, and it will have access to the PVCs that contain the persisted data.

. Delete the Hazelcast cluster:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl delete hazelcast hazelcast
----

. Check that the PVCs are still available:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl get pvc -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=hazelcast
----
+
[source,bash]
----
NAME                                  STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
hot-restart-persistence-hazelcast-0   Bound    pvc-116b4084-a436-4462-b413-511b77df307b   20Gi       RWO            standard       6m
hot-restart-persistence-hazelcast-1   Bound    pvc-a7711b6b-dcbf-45cb-9577-8ce6b1892f2f   20Gi       RWO            standard       5m
hot-restart-persistence-hazelcast-2   Bound    pvc-64314d82-da7a-4e38-bd2d-e770a63dc4e8   20Gi       RWO            standard       5m

----

. Reapply the `Hazelcast` resource:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f ./hazelcast-persistence.yaml
----

. See that the same PVCs are bound to the new pods:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=hazelcast -ojsonpath='{.items[*].spec.volumes[?(@.name=="hot-restart-persistence")].persistentVolumeClaim.claimName}'

----
+
You should see something like the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
hot-restart-persistence-hazelcast-0 hot-restart-persistence-hazelcast-1 hot-restart-persistence-hazelcast-2
----

=== Data Recovery Timeout

To choose a data recovery timeout, you can use dataRecoveryTimeout. The field takes an integer value representing the timeout in seconds and uses this value to set link:https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.1/storage/configuring-persistence#global-persistence-options[validation-timeout-seconds, data-load-timeout-seconds] Hazelcast Persistence options.

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$/hazelcast-persistence-datarecoverytimeout.yaml[]
----

[[recovery-policy]]
== Choosing a Cluster Recovery Policy

To decide how a cluster should behave when one or more members cannot rejoin after a cluster-wide restart, you can define one of the following cluster recovery policies. The Operator supports all the policies in the Hazelcast Platform `cluster-data-recovery-policy configuration` options. For complete descriptions and advice on choosing a policy, see the xref:hazelcast:storage:configuring-persistence.adoc#policy[Platform documentation].

[cols="1,1"]
|===
| ```FullRecoveryOnly```
| Does not allow partial start of the cluster.

| ```PartialRecoveryMostRecent```
| Allows partial start with the members that have most recent partition table.

| ```PartialRecoveryMostComplete```
| Allows partial start with the member that have most complete partition table.
|===

=== Configuring Force-Start

If you use the `FullRecoveryOnly` policy, you can configure the Operator to detect failed Hazelcast members and automatically trigger a force-start. The Operator will trigger a force-start only if the cluster is in a `PASSIVE` state.

WARNING: The cluster loses all persisted data after a force-start.

Enable `autoForceStart`:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$/hazelcast-autoforcestart.yaml[]
----

[[hostpath]]
== HostPath Support for Persistence

You can also use HostPath to enable persistence.

WARNING: HostPath support is discouraged for the production environments for the reasons
mentioned in the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#hostpath[Kubernetes documentation]

WARNING: HostPath support expects the size of the cluster to be equal to the number of Kubernetes nodes
and pods are distributed to the nodes equally. You can manage how pods are distributed among nodes by setting the `topologySpreadContraints` field, which is described in xref:scheduling-configuration.adoc#topology-spread-constraints[Scheduling Hazelcast Pods].

. Create the Hazelcast resource with the `clusterSize` equal to the number of Kubernetes nodes
and give the proper `topologySpreadConstraints`:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$/hazelcast-persistence-hostpath.yaml[]
----

. Apply the Hazelcast resource
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f ./hazelcast-persistence-hostpath.yaml
----
