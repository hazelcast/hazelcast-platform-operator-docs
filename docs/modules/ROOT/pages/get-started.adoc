= Deploy a Cluster with the Hazelcast Platform Operator for Kubernetes
:description: In this tutorial, you'll deploy a Hazelcast cluster using Hazelcast Platform Operator for Kubernetes.

{description}

== Prerequisites

* A Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster
* The link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl[`kubectl`] or link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html[`oc`] command-line tools, configured to communicate with your cluster
* link:https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install[`Helm`]

NOTE: If you want to migrate from the Hazelcast Helm Chart, please follow the guidance in xref:migrating-from-helm.adoc[Migrating from Helm] document.

== Step 1. Deploy Hazelcast Platform Operator

From release 5.6.0 onwards, you can use a Helm chart to install the Hazelcast Platform Operator.

. Add the Hazelcast Helm Charts repository to your Helm repository list by running the following command:

+
[source,shell]
----
helm repo add hazelcast https://hazelcast-charts.s3.amazonaws.com/
helm repo update
----

. You can either deploy the Hazelcast Platform Operator at the same time as CRDs or separately.

+
NOTE: Since CRDs are global resources, they may need to be installed by an administrator.

+
[tabs]
====
Cluster Wide Installation::
+
--
Run the following command to *deploy the Operator and the CRDs together*. By default, the Hazelcast Platform Operator watches all namespaces. Use the `watchedNamespaces` variable to update this configuration.

[source,shell,subs="attributes"]
----
helm install operator hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator --version={operator-chart-version} \
    --set=installCRDs=true
----
--

Restricted Installation::
+
--
Run the following commands to *deploy the Operator and the CRDs separately*. An administrator may need to do this.

[source,shell,subs="attributes"]
----
helm install operator-crds hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator-crds --version={operator-chart-version}
----

After installing CRDs, install the Operator by running the following command. This operation requires only namespace-scoped permissions for `hz-system`, `ns-1` and `ns-2` namespaces which should already exist.

[source,shell,subs="attributes+"]
----
helm install operator hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator --version={operator-chart-version} -n hz-system \
    --set=createClusterScopedResources=false \#<1>
    --set=webhook.enabled=false \#<2>
    --set=enableHazelcastNodeDiscovery=false \#<3>
    --set=installCRDs=false \
    --set=watchedNamespaces="{ns-1, ns-2}"
----
<1> Disabling `createClusterScopedResources` means that the management of resources by Operator is constrained to specified namespaces. This enhances both security and compliance.
<2> Disabling `webhook.enabled` means that webhooks cannot be used. This is needed as the cluster-wide permissions required for webhooks conflict with our restrictions on cluster-scoped resource creation.
<3> Disabling `enableHazelcastNodeDiscovery` means that Operator does not automatically discover nodes across all namespaces. This limits the use of `NODE_AWARE` in `highAvailabilityMode` and of `NodePort` in `discoveryServiceType`, both of which depend on broader node discovery.

====

+
NOTE: You can view all configuration options by running the following command: `helm show values hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator`

+
. Monitor the operator logs. At this point, the Hazelcast Platform Operator should be up and running. You can check it with the command below.

+
[tabs]
====
Kubernetes::
+
--
[source,shell]
----
kubectl logs deployment.apps/operator-hazelcast-platform-operator -n hz-system
----
--
Openshift::
+
--
[source,shell]
----
oc logs deployment.apps/operator-hazelcast-platform-operator -n hz-system
----
--
====

== Step 2. Start the Hazelcast Cluster

After installing and running the Hazelcast Platform Operator, you can create a Hazelcast cluster. 

Hazelcast Enterprise requires a license key. If you don't have a license key, you can request one from the link:http://trialrequest.hazelcast.com/[Hazelcast website].

. Create a Kubernetes secret to hold your license key.
+
.For Kubernetes
[source,shell]
----
kubectl create secret generic hazelcast-license-key --from-literal=license-key=<YOUR LICENSE KEY>
----
+
.For Openshift
[source,shell]
----
oc create secret generic hazelcast-license-key --from-literal=license-key=<YOUR LICENSE KEY>
----

. Create the `Hazelcast` custom resource file and name it `hazelcast-enterprise.yaml`.
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$/hazelcast-enterprise.yaml[]
----

. Apply the custom resource to start the Hazelcast cluster.
+
.For Kubernetes
[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f hazelcast-enterprise.yaml
----
+
.For Openshift
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f hazelcast-enterprise.yaml
----

. Verify that Hazelcast cluster is up and running by checking the Hazelcast member logs.
+
.For Kubernetes
[source,shell]
----
kubectl logs pod/hazelcast-sample-0
----
+
.For Openshift
[source,shell]
----
oc logs pod/hazelcast-sample-0
----

You should see the following:

```
Members {size:3, ver:3} [
        Member [10.36.8.3]:5701 - ccf31703-de3b-4094-9faf-7b5d0dc145b2 this
        Member [10.36.7.2]:5701 - e75bd6e2-de4b-4360-8113-040773d858b7
        Member [10.36.6.2]:5701 - c3d105d2-0bca-4a66-8519-1cacffc05c98
]
```

== Step 3. Check that the Hazelcast Cluster is Running

To check if a cluster is running, see the `status` field of the Hazelcast resource.

The status can be checked using the `get hazelcast` command.

[tabs]
====
Kubernetes::
+
--
[source,shell]
----
kubectl get hazelcast
----
--
Openshift::
+
--
[source,shell]
----
oc get hazelcast
----
--
====

```
NAME               STATUS    MEMBERS
hazelcast-sample   Running   3/3
```

You can use the following command for the long format.


[tabs]
====
Kubernetes::
+
--
[source,shell]
----
kubectl get hazelcast hazelcast-sample -o=yaml
----
--
Openshift::
+
--
[source,shell]
----
oc get hazelcast hazelcast-sample -o=yaml
----
--
====

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
status:
  hazelcastClusterStatus:
    readyMembers: 3/3
  phase: Running
----

The `phase` field represents the current status of the cluster, and can contain any of the following values:

* `Running`: The cluster is up and running.
* `Pending`: The cluster is in the process of starting.
* `Failed`: An error occurred while starting the cluster.

Any additional information such as validation errors will be provided in the `message` field.

The `readyMembers` field represents the number of Hazelcast members that are connected to the cluster.

WARNING: Use the `readyMembers` field only for informational purposes. This field is not always accurate. Some members may have joined or left the cluster since this field was last updated.


== Step 4. Clean up

Run the following commands to remove Hazelcast cluster and Hazelcast License Key Secret.

[tabs]
====
Kubernetes::
+
--
[source,shell]
----
kubectl delete -f hazelcast-enterprise.yaml
kubectl delete secret hazelcast-license-key
----
--
Openshift::
+
--
[source,shell]
----
oc delete -f hazelcast-enterprise.yaml
oc delete secret hazelcast-license-key
----
--
====

Finally, run the command below to delete the Hazelcast Platform Operator deployment.

[source,shell]
----
helm uninstall operator
----

If you installed the CRDs separately from the operator, you need to remove them by running the following command:

[source,shell]
----
helm uninstall operator-crds
----
