= Configure diagnostic logging
:description: Hazelcast offers an extended set of diagnostics plugins for both Hazelcast members and clients. A dedicated log file is used to write the diagnostics content, and a rolling file approach is used to prevent taking up too much disk space.

{description}

Using the Operator, you can switch diagnostic logging on and off at runtime (known as dynamic configuration) without having to restart the cluster.

This section explains how to configure diagnostics for Hazelcast clusters managed by the Hazelcast Platform Operator, including enabling diagnostics, setting auto turn-off to avoid disk overuse, forwarding diagnostics to your logging framework, and persisting diagnostics to a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC).

== Enable diagnostics using the CRD

To enable diagnostics, use the Hazelcast custom resource (CRD):

* Fields include outputType (STDOUT, LOGGER, FILE), includeEpochTime, maxRolledFileSize, maxRolledFileCount, fileNamePrefix, pluginProperties, autoOffTimerInMinutes, and pvcName. For more information, see: https://docs.hazelcast.com/operator/latest-snapshot/api-ref#diagnostics[Diagnostics].
* File-based rolling limits can also be controlled via DiagnosticsFileConfiguration (maxRolledFileSizeInMB, maxRolledFileCount, fileNamePrefix) where applicable. See: https://docs.hazelcast.com/operator/latest-snapshot/api-ref#diagnosticsfileconfiguration[DiagnosticsFileConfiguration].

The diagnostics file rolls by default (10 files, 50 MB each) and contains plugin sections. For information about the
default plugins, see https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/latest/maintain-cluster/monitoring#diagnostics-plugins[Diagnostics Plugins].

*Example:*

* outputType: choose the output destination (e.g. FILE or STDOUT). The default is STDOUT in Operator.

// Sergii - should we say: "We recommend you use the default, STDOUT"
// And do we even want to mention all the following fields?

* maxRolledFileSize / maxRolledFileCount: cap file size and retention.
* pluginProperties: pass the same diagnostics system properties shown above (e.g. enable plugins or adjust their periods).
* autoOffTimerInMinutes: configure automatic turn-off (see below).
* pvcName: bind diagnostics to a PVC (see below).
* fileNamePrefix: add a custom prefix.

== Configure auto turn-off

To prevent diagnostic logs from running indefinitely and having a performance impact on the cluster, set the Operator's `autoOffTimerInMinutes` to automatically disable diagnostic logging after the specified number of minutes. See https://docs.hazelcast.com/operator/latest-snapshot/api-ref#diagnostics[Diagnostics].

You can combine this with rolling limits:

* Operator diagnostics: maxRolledFileSize, maxRolledFileCount.
* Hazelcast properties: hazelcast.diagnostics.max.rolled.file.size.mb and hazelcast.diagnostics.max.rolled.file.count.

== Forward diagnostics to a logging framework

Instead of file output, you can forward diagnostics to your logging framework by setting `spec.diagnostics.outputType=LOGGER`

Then configure the com.hazelcast.diagnostics logger (e.g. a Log4j2 logger and rolling appender) to control size and rollover using time/size policies. For information, see https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/latest/maintain-cluster/monitoring#diagnostics-using-logging-frameworks[Diagnostics using Logging Frameworks].

== Persist diagnostics to a PVC

To retain diagnostics across pod restarts and isolate them from container stdout, mount a Persistent Volume Claim and direct diagnostics there:

* Set the diagnostics output to files and point the directory to a mounted path using hazelcast.diagnostics.directory.
* In the Operator, specify `pvcName` in the diagnostics config to mount a PVC for diagnostics. This instructs the Operator to use the named PVC for diagnostics storage (the detailed mounting YAML is not included in the sources).

NOTE: System log diagnostics (cluster activity and optional partition migration details) can be enabled/tuned via `hazelcast.diagnostics.systemlog.enabled` and `hazelcast.diagnostics.systemlog.partitions` if needed. See https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/latest/maintain-cluster/monitoring#systemlog[SystemLog].

== Configure diagnostics via system properties

Diagnostic logging can also be configured _statically_ via system properties set in Hazelcast Platform, and enabled with rolling log controls and output destination. 

However, if you enable or disable diagnostic logging using system properties, these settings will override any configuration settings applied using the CRD, and you will be unable to switch logging on and off _dynamically_ at runtime. 

For more information about system properties, see https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/latest/maintain-cluster/monitoring#diagnostics[Enable diagnostics].
