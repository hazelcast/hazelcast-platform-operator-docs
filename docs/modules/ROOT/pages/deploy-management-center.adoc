= Deploy Management Center with the Hazelcast Platform Operator for Kubernetes
:description: In this tutorial, you'll deploy an instance of Management Center using Hazelcast Platform Operator for Kubernetes.

{description}

== Before you Begin

You need a Kubernetes or Openshift cluster, and the `kubectl` or `oc` command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster.

Please make sure xref:get-started.adoc[Hazelcast Platform Operator for Kubernetes] is up and running.

== Deploy Management Center

You can monitor the Hazelcast cluster by starting Management Center.

To enable some features or dashboard at Management Center, you need a license key. If you don't have a license key, you can request one from the link:http://trialrequest.hazelcast.com/[Hazelcast website].

. Create a Kubernetes secret to hold your license key.
+
.For Kubernetes
[source,shell]
----
kubectl create secret generic hazelcast-license-key --from-literal=license-key=<YOUR LICENSE KEY>
----
+
.For Openshift
[source,shell]
----
oc create secret generic hazelcast-license-key --from-literal=license-key=<YOUR LICENSE KEY>
----

. Create the `ManagementCenter` custom resource file and name it `management-center.yaml`.
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$/management-center-with-license-key.yaml[]
----

. Apply it with the following command to start Management Center.
+
.For Kubernetes
[source,shell]
----
kubectl apply -f management-center.yaml
----
+
.For Openshift
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f management-center.yaml
----


. After a moment, you can verify that Management Center is up and running by checking the Management Center logs.
+
.For Kubernetes
[source,shell]
----
kubectl logs pod/managementcenter-sample-0
----
+
.For Openshift
[source,shell]
----
oc logs pod/managementcenter-sample-0
----

```

To access the Management Center dashboard, open the browser at address `http://$MANCENTER_IP:8080`.

== Clean up

#Authors note - Is clean up part of the deployment process or is it only something you'd do if you wanted to remove the Management Center? In what circumstances might you do this? Perhaps this should be a separate topic and not part of Deployment? Please advise.#

You can run the commands below to remove the Management Center.

====
Kubernetes::
+

[source,shell]
----
kubectl delete -f management-center.yaml
----
--
Openshift::

[source,shell]

oc delete -f management-center.yaml
