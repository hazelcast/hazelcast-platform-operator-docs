= Configuring Topics
:description: pass:q[Hazelcast provides a distribution mechanism for publishing messages that are delivered to multiple subscribers. This is known as a publish/subscribe (pub/sub) messaging model. Publishing and subscription operations are cluster wide. When a member subscribes to a topic, it is registered to receive messages published by any member in the cluster, including any new members that joined after you added the listener. You can create and configure topics using the `Topic` custom resource.]
