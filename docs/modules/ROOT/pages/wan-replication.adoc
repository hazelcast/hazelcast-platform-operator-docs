= Configuring WAN Replication
:description: pass:q[WAN Replication allows you to keep Hazelcast clusters in sync across multiple sites or cloud deployments. In Hazelcast Platform Operator, you can create a `WanReplication` resource to replicate multiple maps from multiple source clusters to a single target Hazelcast cluster. ]
:page-enterprise: true

{description}

See xref:hazelcast:wan:wan.adoc[WAN replication] for more detailed information about the configuration and behavior of WAN replication in Hazelcast.

== Prerequisites for WAN Replication

Before you create and configure a `WanReplication` resource, you need to create the following:

- At least one `Hazelcast` resource and one `Map` resource for the source Hazelcast cluster.
- A target Hazelcast cluster that is accessible from the source cluster.      

== Configuring the WanReplication Resource

You can use the following configuration options in your `WanReplication` resource. For more detailed information, see the xref:api-ref.adoc#wanreplicationspec[API Reference].

|===
|Field|Description

|`resources`
|The list of the custom `Map` or `Hazelcast` resource to which WAN replication applies.

- `name`: The name of custom resource to which WAN replication applies.
- `kind`: The kind of custom resource. Either `Map`(default) or `Hazelcast`. The kind `Hazelcast` leads to apply WAN replication to the all custom maps created under the given Hazelcast resource.

|`targetClusterName`
|The name of the Hazelcast cluster that is the target of replication.

|`endpoints`
|A comma-separated list of the addresses of the Hazelcast members in the target cluster.

|`queue`
|The configuration of the WAN events queue, which includes two related parameters:

- `capacity`: The total capacity of WAN events queue. The `fullBehavior` is triggered when the number of events exceeds this limit.
- `fullBehavior`: What happens to new events that arrive after the events queue is full.

|`batch`
|How WAN replication events are batched.

- `size`: The maximum batch size.
- `maximumDelay`: If the batch size is not reached, the events will be sent after the maximum delay (in milliseconds).

|`acknowledgement`
|Configuration of the acknowledgement sent after a batch of replication events is received by the target cluster:

- `type`: Whether an acknowledgement is sent as soon as the batch of events is received (`ACK_ON_RECEIPT`) or after each update is applied to the target cluster (`ACK_ON_OPERATION_COMPLETE`).
- `timeout`: The period of time the source cluster waits for the acknowledgement. If the confirmation is not received before the timeout, the replication events are resent.

== Example Configuration

The following `WanReplication` resource creates the WAN replication configuration for the `Hazelcast` and `Map` resources on the source Hazelcast cluster.

.Example configuration
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$/wan-replication-example.yaml[]
----


== Checking the Status of a WAN Replication

After creating the `WanReplication` resource, run the following command to find out the WAN replication status:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl get wanreplication wanreplication-sample
----

The returned status message will look something like this:

----
NAME                     STATUS    MESSAGE
wanreplication-sample    Success
----

You can also monitor the status of the WAN replications in xref:get-started.adoc#step-4-start-management-center[Management Center].
